## Useful Module


</div>

### Description

This module is packed with well over 120 subs! Including: Hypno form, ShutDown/Reboot, Save/Load, Rounding, Encryption, Spots, Telephone-Text decoder and loads more! Also there are plenty of mathematical functions (including a string parser and a string evaluator). As well as metric-imperial/imperial-metric conversions and currency conversions.

This module is useful not only to learn from, but also to have fun with. Uses a few API calls, but nothing dodgy. Check it out.

Any comments are gratefully recieved. Please vote.
